## Project Overview: Death Rates in the United States
For our final project, we decided to work with a data set created by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This data set includes the crude death rate and age adjusted death rate of the top leading causes of death in the United States. Our interactive webpage is intended for individuals who are interested in learning about the top leading causes of deaths in the United States, whether it be by year, states, or as a nation. We are hoping these individuals have a goal of using this data in order to figure out what causes are most important to address in order to decrease death rate due to these causes.

Through our project, we want to answer these three questions for our audience:

1. How many states have had a specific leading cause of death?
2. How do causes of death (on national) change over time (if any)?
3. What are the all time leading causes of death in each state?

##List of what we need to do
1. Andrew: Create a histogram comparing how many states have a death rate for a specific cause by year 
2. Yan: Creat a line graph of national deaths for individual causes over time
3. Connor: Create a map that shows specific cause of death of the total amount of people that died in that state because of that cause.
